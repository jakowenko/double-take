# Frigate Events

Process [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate) images with [Facebox](https://machinebox.io) and/or [CompreFace](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace).

Frigate Events exposes a RESTful endpoint and/or can subscribe to Frigate's MQTT topic to process events for facial recognition. When an event is received the API begins to process the `snapshot.jpg` and `latest.jpg` images from Frigate's API. Images are passed from the API to the detector(s) specified until a match is found above the defined confidence level. To improve the chances of finding a match, the processing of the images will repeat until the amount of retries is exhausted or a match is found. If a match is found the image is then saved to `/storage/matches/${frigate-event-id}-${image-type}.jpg`.

## API

Frigate Events exposes a `/recognize` endpoint where Frigate MQTT events can be POSTed to for processing.

**Sample Payload**

```json
{
  "before": {
    "camera": "living-room",
    "label": "person",
    "score": ".60",
    "id": "1614048341.992271-6jkzwi"
  },
  "type": "start",
  ...
}
```

**Sample Response Body**

```json
{
  "id": "1614048341.992271-6jkzwi",
  "duration": 0.78,
  "time": "03/05/2021 02:54:55 AM",
  "attempts": 16,
  "camera": "living-room",
  "room": "Living Room",
  "matches": [
    {
      "name": "david",
      "confidence": 77.12,
      "attempt": 1,
      "detector": "facebox",
      "type": "latest",
      "duration": 0.78
    }
  ]
}
```

## MQTT

Frigate Events has the ability to subscribe to Frigate's MQTT topic and process events as they are received.

If a match is found then a new topic will be created with the default format being `frigate-events/matches/${name}`.

**Sample Topic Value**

```json
{
  "id": "1614931108.689332-6uu8kk",
  "duration": 0.85,
  "time": "03/05/2021 02:58:57 AM",
  "attempts": 4,
  "camera": "living-room",
  "room": "Living Room",
  "match": {
    "name": "david",
    "confidence": 82.6,
    "attempt": 1,
    "detector": "compreface",
    "type": "snapshot",
    "duration": 0.39
  }
}
```
