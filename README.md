# Double Take

Unified UI and API for processing and training images for facial recognition.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1081811/126434926-cf2275f7-f3a8-43eb-adc2-903c0071f7d1.jpg" width="100%">
</p>

## Why?

There's a lot of great open source software to perform facial recognition, but each of them behave differently. Double Take was created to abstract the complexities of the detection services and combine them into an easy to use UI and API.

## Features

- Responsive UI and API bundled into single [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakowenko/double-take)
- Ability to [password protect](#authentication) UI and API
- Support for [multiple detectors](#supported-detectors)
- Train and untrain images for subjects
- Process images from [NVRs](#supported-nvrs)
- Publish results to [MQTT topics](#mqtt-1)
- [REST API](#api) can be invoked by other applications
- Disable detection based on a [schedule](#schedule)
- [Home Assistant Add-ons](https://github.com/jakowenko/double-take-hassio-addons)
- Preprocess images with [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d1/de5/classcv_1_1CascadeClassifier.html)

### Supported Architecture

- amd64
- arm64
- arm/v7

### Supported Detectors

- [CompreFace](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace) v0.5.0-1.0.0
- [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition)
- [DeepStack](https://deepstack.cc) v2021.02.1-2022.01.01
- [Facebox](https://machinebox.io)

### Supported NVRs

- [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate) v0.8.0-0.11.0

## Integrations

### [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate)

Subscribe to Frigate's MQTT topics and process images for analysis.

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: localhost

frigate:
  url: http://localhost:5000
```

When the `frigate/events` topic is updated the API begins to process the [`snapshot.jpg`](https://blakeblackshear.github.io/frigate/usage/api/#apieventsidsnapshotjpg) and [`latest.jpg`](https://blakeblackshear.github.io/frigate/usage/api/#apicamera_namelatestjpgh300) images from Frigate's API. These images are passed from the API to the configured detector(s) until a match is found that meets the configured requirements. To improve the chances of finding a match, the processing of the images will repeat until the amount of retries is exhausted or a match is found.

When the `frigate/+/person/snapshot` topic is updated the API will process that image with the configured detector(s). It is recommended to increase the MQTT snapshot size in the [Frigate camera config](https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/index).

```yaml
cameras:
  front-door:
    mqtt:
      timestamp: False
      bounding_box: False
      crop: True
      quality: 100
      height: 500
```

If a match is found the image is saved to `/.storage/matches/<filename>`.

### [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

Trigger automations / notifications when images are processed.

If the MQTT integration is configured within Home Assistant, then sensors will automatically be created.

#### Notification Automation

This notification will work for both matches and unknown results. The message can be customized with any of the attributes from the entity.

```yaml
alias: Notify
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.double_take_david
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.double_take_unknown
condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: '{{ trigger.to_state.state != trigger.from_state.state }}'
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      message: |-
        {% if trigger.to_state.attributes.match is defined %}
          {{trigger.to_state.attributes.friendly_name}} is near the {{trigger.to_state.state}} @ {{trigger.to_state.attributes.match.confidence}}% by {{trigger.to_state.attributes.match.detector}}:{{trigger.to_state.attributes.match.type}} taking {{trigger.to_state.attributes.attempts}} attempt(s) @ {{trigger.to_state.attributes.duration}} sec
        {% elif trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown is defined %}
          unknown is near the {{trigger.to_state.state}} @ {{trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown.confidence}}% by {{trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown.detector}}:{{trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown.type}} taking {{trigger.to_state.attributes.attempts}} attempt(s) @ {{trigger.to_state.attributes.duration}} sec
        {% endif %}
      data:
        attachment:
          url: |-
            {% if trigger.to_state.attributes.match is defined %}
              http://localhost:3000/api/storage/matches/{{trigger.to_state.attributes.match.filename}}?box=true&token={{trigger.to_state.attributes.token}}
            {% elif trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown is defined %}
               http://localhost:3000/api/storage/matches/{{trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown.filename}}?box=true&token={{trigger.to_state.attributes.token}}
            {% endif %}
        actions:
          - action: URI
            title: View Image
            uri: |-
              {% if trigger.to_state.attributes.match is defined %}
                http://localhost:3000/api/storage/matches/{{trigger.to_state.attributes.match.filename}}?box=true&token={{trigger.to_state.attributes.token}}
              {% elif trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown is defined %}
                 http://localhost:3000/api/storage/matches/{{trigger.to_state.attributes.unknown.filename}}?box=true&token={{trigger.to_state.attributes.token}}
              {% endif %}
mode: parallel
max: 10
```

### MQTT

Publish results to `double-take/matches/<name>` and `double-take/cameras/<camera>`. The number of results will also be published to `double-take/cameras/<camera>/person` and will reset back to `0` after 30 seconds.

Errors from the API will be published to `double-take/errors`.

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: localhost
```

## Notify Services

### [Gotify](https://gotify.net)

```yaml
notify:
  gotify:
    url: http://localhost:8080
    token:
```

## API Images

Match images are saved to `/.storage/matches` and can be accessed via `http://localhost:3000/api/storage/matches/<filename>`.

Training images are saved to `/.storage/train` and can be accessed via `http://localhost:3000/api/storage/train/<name>/<filename>`.

Latest images are saved to `/.storage/latest` and can be accessed via `http://localhost:3000/api/storage/latest/<name|camera>.jpg`.

| Query Parameters | Description                    | Default |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `box`            | Show bounding box around faces | `false` |
| `token`          | Access token                   |         |

## UI

The UI is accessible via `http://localhost:3000`.

- Matches: `/`
- Train: `/train`
- Config: `/config`
- Access Tokens: `/tokens` (_if authentication is enabled_)

## Authentication

Enable authentication to password protect the UI. This is recommended if running Double Take behind a reverse proxy which is exposed to the internet.

```yaml
auth: true
```

## API

Documentation can be viewed on [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1013188/TzsWuAa8).

## Storing Secrets

**Note:** If using one of the [Home Assistant Add-ons](https://github.com/jakowenko/double-take-hassio-addons) then the default Home Assistant `/config/secrets.yaml` file is used.

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: localhost
  username: mqtt
  password: !secret mqtt_password

detectors:
  compreface:
    url: localhost:8000
    key: !secret compreface_key
```

The `secrets.yml` file contains the corresponding value assigned to the identifier.

```yaml
mqtt_password: <password>
compreface_key: <api-key>
```
